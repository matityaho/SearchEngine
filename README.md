# Search_Engine
The is a search engine project.
We implement many methods and learn who is the "best" search engine from that.
The methods:
1. WordNet (Search_Engine1)
2. Word2Vec (Search_Engine2: Search2, Indexer2)
3. SpellChecker (Search_Engine3: Search3)
4. Thesaurus (Search_Engine4: Search4)
5. Advanced Parser (Search_Engine5: Search5, Parser_Module5)????
---> Best Engine (Word2Vec + Advanced Parser: Search_Engine2, Search2, Indexer2, Parser_Module5)
